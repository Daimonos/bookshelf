# Go-Bookshelf
A pet project written in Go

## Motivation
I have a bunch of books and I hand them off to people to read all the time.The problem is that I forget to whom I've lent them to! This is a quick and dirty app that allows me to keep track of this

## Tech
1. Boltdb for the datastore
2. Cobra for parsing the cli
3. Gorilla for API (coming soon)

## Getting Started
1. Install Go
2. Clone the Repo
3. Build with `go build`
4. Run it with `go-bookshelf`
